I've created a comprehensive solution for the e-commerce data analysis assignment. The solution includes:

EDA Notebook (FirstName_LastName_EDA.ipynb):
Data loading and preprocessing
Exploratory analysis
Visualization of key metrics
Business insights generation
Lookalike Model Notebook (FirstName_LastName_Lookalike.ipynb):
Feature engineering
Similarity calculation using cosine similarity
Top 3 similar customers for first 20 customers
Results export to CSV
Clustering Analysis Notebook (FirstName_LastName_Clustering.ipynb):
Feature preparation
K-means clustering
Davies-Bouldin Index calculation
Cluster visualization and analysis
PDF Reports:
Detailed business insights
Methodology explanation
Results interpretation
Recommendations

The notebooks will generate the required CSV files and visualizations
PDF reports provide comprehensive documentation of findings
The solution uses only Python standard library and common data science packages (pandas, numpy, scikit-learn) for compatibility.
